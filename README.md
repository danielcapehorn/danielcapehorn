# Hi, I'm Dan ðŸ‘‹

A Data Analytics enthusiast and current Financial Analyst. My Portfolio comprises case studies that have been either undertaken through certifications, or just because I find them interesting. 

My main fields of interest are: SQL; Tableau, R; Python. However, I can't deny that I am probably way too enthusiastic about Excel...
